  you have to type words and press enter to comfirm and proceed

You Can in fact:

* move around the map after selecting (1, move) then you can move
  using (1, 2, 3, 4, up, down, left, right)
  or you can teleport using potions (if you have some in inventry).  

* fight monsters to earn EXP AND GOLD
  (the higher up and the more you go to the right, 
  the more challanging the enemy's are and the more GOLD and EXP you get)
  
  or spare most of them by acting.

* fight bosses to earn EXP AND GOLD

* solve puzzles to earn GOLD (and maybe unlock somthing)

* You can go to a shop and buy:
	Potions 100 gold
	Teleports 30 gold
	Talk to the Shopkeeper 0 gold (woah what a steal, please dont)
	Hip sword 200 gold (unlocked on level 15)
	Upgrade HP ? gold (unlocked on level 15)

* Rest at your house and vibe (or find somthing else...)
      Note - Sleeping does not recover your health or do anything

* Try compleating all 7 quests and earn more money and get an item in return

* collect all the wepons 
  (Note: wepons will be lost and never be able recover again 
  if you dicide to throw them away.)

You can attempt hard mode if you are up for the challenge 
by typing "god" on the role selection screen
   Note - enemys are more powerful by having more HP and POW
	   enemys give less EXP and GOLD once defeated

Things to note:
* i dont recomend typing super fast.  

* it is recomended to save the game offten. there is no auto saving 
  (exept at faze 3 of the final boss after beating him)
 
* I do not own most of the sprites used in my game.
  this game was a passion project inspired by the two Indie JRPG games
  called UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE by Toby Fox
